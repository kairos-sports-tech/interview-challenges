# Javascript challenge

## Task

We would like you to implement and test some functions in javascript.

In the `src` folder there are two files: `events.js` and `events.test.js`.

You should read the descriptions provided and implement the functions, then
write some tests that demonstrates your implementations work correctly.

You will probably want to use a date library to make things a little easier,
this project has both [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) and
[moment](https://momentjs.com) installed, though its ok if you want to use
something else too.

Check out the documentation for [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for help writing your
tests.

## Setup

You need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Then run `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In this directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Run the tests that verify your implementations.

### `npm run format`

This will format your code automatically.

## Evaluation criteria

Here's what we are looking for to figure out if this is a good solution:

- How have you structured your code
- Have you written any tests
- Do all your tests pass
- Do you handle edges cases
- Does your testcase naming help you understand the what and why of what's being
  tested
- Does your code use easy to understand variable names?
